Problem 6.1 - Abstract Superclass Problem6_1.Shape and Its Concrete Subclasses

Q- What is the usage of the abstract method and abstract class?

A- Abstract methods and classes are used in OOP(object-orientated programming) to build reusable code.

Abstract classes provide a blueprint for classes that share certain characteristics but implement differently.
For instance a dog and a cat may both use the method speak(), however the dog will speak as "woof" and the cat
will speak as "meow". By both dog and cat classes inheriting the speak method along with other shared methods
from an abstract class it reduces code. If you want to implement consistent behaviours you could do this with
an abstract class. An abstract class can provide all subclasses with specific behaviours. This will give your
code more structure and organization as well as not repeating code.

An abstract method is a method declared without an implementation and can only be defined within an abstract
class or interface. Abstract methods act as placeholders that subclasses must implement. This ensures that
all subclasses provide a specific behaviour and leaves the exact implementation of that behaviour to each
individual subclass.
